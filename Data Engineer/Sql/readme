Learning sql 
DAY 1: {
(select, from, where ( used for filtering before the aggregate function ))
( order by: Order the rows through the selected column
        groupby: group the columns with same values and provide a new table fror aggregate function
( having : used for filtering after the  aggregate functions ( condition ).
        distinct:  remove the duplicates from the table.
        Top: Use for limiting the rows or like for getting only the defined no of rows.)
practice day 1 ( all queries written above ).}

The execution order will be :
4 select
1 from 
2 where
5 orderby 
3 groupby }

DAY 2: {
DDL==DATA DEFEINITION LANGUAGE
1.CREATE: Use for creating the table. 
2.ALTER: Use for altering ( adding or removing ) the table through column and rows.
3.DROP: Use for dropping the define table. }

DAY 3: {
1.INSERT INTO: Use for inserting the data into the table through query.
2.UPDATE (TABLE NAME): update the table's rows which falls into the given condition. 
3.DELETE TABLE (TABLE NAME): Delete the rows which falls into the given condition.
4.TRUNCATE TABLE (TABLE NAME): Delete the rows and columns of the table which keeping the table.

DAY 4: {
WHERE == Use for conditional operations.
1.Comparision operators:
(=)         : is equal to.
(!=) , (<>) : not equal to.
(>=)        : greater than equal to.
(<=)        : less than equal to.
(<)         : less than.
(>)         : greater than.
2.logical operators:
AND : All the conditions must be true.
OR  : One condition must be true.
NOT : Reverse the condition's effect.
3.Range Operatiors:
BETWEEN : search in the given range.
4.Membership Operators:
IN    : check the value from the given list.
NOT IN: give the values other than the list .
5.Search Operators:
Like: take the patter and then search according to it.
(%)= anything (a%) anything after a   - (%a): last element should be a.
(_): position _ it leave the first element only - __ it means the leave the starting 2 element only - ___ it means leave the starting 3 elements only
}

Day 5: {
JOIN : It is used for joining data of two or more tables. It's types are given below.
1. Inner Join: It return only the matching rows from both the tables.
2. Left Join: It return all the rows from the left (first) table and also the matching rows from both the tables.
3. Right Join:It return all the rows from the right (last) table and also the matching rows from both the tables.
4. Full Join: It return all the rows from both the table as concatenated.
} 

Day 6: {
Advanced Joins:
1. Left Anti Join: Return the rows form the left which are not matching with the right.
2. Right Anti Join: Return the rows from the right which are not match with the left.
3. Full Anti Join: Return the rows from the both table except the matching rows.
4. Cross Join: Return every row from both left and riht table providing all the possible combinations as cartesian Join.
 
}

Practice 2 (Level 1 — Warm-up): { practicing joins and where clause }
Practice 3 (Level 2 — Filtering & Logic): { practicing joins more and repeating where clause building some logic solving gpt given problems }
Practice 4 (Level 3 — Aggreagation & Join): { practicing joins more and repeating where clause building some logic solving gpt given problems }

Day 7: {
Multiple Tables Join
}
Day 8: {
Set operations:
 set operators combine the result of multiple queries in a result set.
}



NOTE:
SQL Joints are used for the combination of columns.
SQL sets are aused for the combination of rows.
